QPLEX is a computational methodology for modeling and analyzing a broad class of 
nonstationary stochastic systems with large state spaces.
QPLEX calculations are deterministic and approximate. 
More information can be found on the `QPLEX website <https://qplex.org/>`_.

The **QPLEX Python Package** is a collection of software tools that perform calculations for a number of 
standard stochastic models supported by the QPLEX methodology. These represent a very small subset of models 
supported by the QPLEX methodology. It is possible to extend the package with the 
`Q Development Kit <https://github.com/qplex/qdk>`_.

The documentation for the QPLEX Python Package is available `here <https://qplex.org/documentation/>`_. 

The source is hosted on `GitHub <https://github.com/qplex/qplex-python-package/>`_.
